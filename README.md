## AI-Powered Smart Irrigation

The AI-Powered Smart Irrigation System uses IoT sensors and artificial intelligence to manage irrigation automatically. It monitors soil moisture and environmental conditions in real time. Based on AI predictions, the system controls water supply efficiently. This helps reduce water wastage and improve crop productivity.

## About
This project focuses on developing an AI-Powered Smart Irrigation System to automate and optimize agricultural irrigation. IoT sensors are used to collect real-time data such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. An AI-based prediction model analyzes this data to decide when irrigation is required. The system automatically controls the water pump and provides alerts to the user, helping conserve water, reduce manual effort, and support sustainable farming.

## Features

* Real-time monitoring of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity
* AI-based prediction for irrigation requirement
* Automatic control of water pump without manual intervention
* Cloud integration for data storage and monitoring
* SMS/alert notification for irrigation activity
* Reduces water wastage and improves crop yield
* User-friendly and scalable for small and large farms
