## AI-Powered Smart Irrigation

The AI-Powered Smart Irrigation System uses IoT sensors and artificial intelligence to manage irrigation automatically. It monitors soil moisture and environmental conditions in real time. Based on AI predictions, the system controls water supply efficiently. This helps reduce water wastage and improve crop productivity.

## About
This project focuses on developing an AI-Powered Smart Irrigation System to automate and optimize agricultural irrigation. IoT sensors are used to collect real-time data such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. An AI-based prediction model analyzes this data to decide when irrigation is required. The system automatically controls the water pump and provides alerts to the user, helping conserve water, reduce manual effort, and support sustainable farming.

The AI-Powered Smart Irrigation System was successfully implemented and tested using real-time sensor data and AI-based predictions. The system accurately monitored soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, and automatically controlled the irrigation process based on the predicted water requirement. The experimental results showed a significant reduction in unnecessary irrigation and improved accuracy in water scheduling.

The system helped achieve better water conservation by supplying water only when required, reducing wastage caused by manual or timer-based irrigation methods. It also reduced human effort by automating irrigation control and providing timely alerts. Overall, the project demonstrates a positive impact on sustainable agriculture by improving crop health, optimizing water usage, and supporting smart farming practices.
